Romanesque to Gothic Development of cathedral architecture
About 6th to 11th century, People in medieval Europe built cathedrals with Romanesque style. The word ‘Romanesque’ means ‘Roman like’. For the long time, this style was used to build cathedrals but, after 12th century, the new style of cathedrals appeared and lasted into about 16th century. This style is called Gothic. Gothic derives from Goths, an East German people, so Gothic means ‘Goths like’. Today I`m going talk about the differences and developments of Romanesque and Gothic Architecture.
##Romanesque Architecture
 Romanesque-style cathedrals are known by its massive quality. The cathedral Pisa in Italy is one of the examples. [Show Pic1] It has many characteristic components. First of all, the thick wall is very famous. In order to support massive building, very strong components were needed. Many big pillars are used in them by same reason. The round arch is another feature. You can see many big pillar and round arches inside and outside of Pisa Cathedral. [Indicate Pic1 and Show Pic2] The large cathedrals was built for the evidence of a strong rivalry for other maritime republics Venice to see which create the most beautiful and luxurious place of worship, that is cathedral. The massive style of this cathedral is the result of the rivalry. Romanesque style also still has characteristics. They are symmetrical and most of their vaults are like barrel which is cut in half. So, this type is called ‘barrel vault’. When it is compared with Gothic style, it can be said that Romanesque is simpler and less decorative.
They have small windows that light doesn`t pass through. So, inside of cathedrals are often dark.
##Gothic Architecture
 Gothic Architecture is characterized by its decorative design. There are much more sculptures than Romanesque style. Particularly, three features are typical of Gothic architecture, pointed arch, the ribbed vault, and flying buttress.
