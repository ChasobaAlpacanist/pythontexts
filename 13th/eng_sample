Dear Sir or Madam
I am writing to ask if you could send me a copy of your school catalog and the most recent application form for international students
I am currently studying Sociology at ICC University in Tokyo and I am interested in transferring to your Undergraduate Programs starting Spring 2008
If there is any additional information or forms that are necessary for the transfer process could you please include them with the catalog
Thank you for your prompt attention, and I look forward to receiving the catalog
Sincerely yours
